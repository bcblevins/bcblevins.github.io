            I'm a Full Stack Developer with a passion for building scalable, efficient solutions that
            empower users.
            <br>
            With experience in technologies like Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Python, and Vue.js, I enjoy
            tackling
            complex challenges and delivering creative, impactful results.
            <br>
            One of my key projects, VetRA, showcases my
            ability
            to create full stack applications that solve real-world problems, such as improving communication between
            veterinary clinics and their clients. I approach challenges without hesitation, applying both technical
            expertise
            and a creativity to deliver impactful results.
